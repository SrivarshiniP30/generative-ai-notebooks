 Generative AI Notebooks: A Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my personal Jupyter notebooks and projects documenting my exploration into the fascinating world of Generative AI. It serves as a practical portfolio of my work and a reference for the concepts I'm studying, from the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs) to advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## üöÄ Key Concepts Covered

This repository contains hands-on code for the following topics:

* **ü§ñ LLM Basics:** Foundational concepts and interactions with large language models.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Prompt Engineering:** Techniques for crafting effective prompts to guide model behavior, including:
    * Zero-Shot
    * One-Shot
    * Few-Shot prompting
* **üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The complete pipeline for building systems that can answer questions based on private data.
    * **Data Loading:** Ingesting various document types (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`).
    * **Chunking:** Splitting documents into manageable sizes.
    * **Embeddings & Encoding:** Converting text into vector representations.
    * **Vector Databases:** Storing and querying vectors using `FAISS`, `ChromaDB`, and `Qdrant`.
* **üîó LangChain:** Using this powerful framework to streamline the development of LLM applications.
* **üß† TensorFlow Basics:** Fundamental operations in TensorFlow, a core machine learning library.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic to make navigation easy:

* **/LLMbasics:** Introductory notebooks on LLMs.
* **/prompt_eng:** Contains notebooks demonstrating various prompt engineering strategies.
* **/RAG:** A deep dive into the components of the RAG pipeline, with dedicated notebooks for each step.
* **/langchain.ipynb:** A notebook focused on implementing solutions with the LangChain framework.
