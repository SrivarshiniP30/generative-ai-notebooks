We provide you with visibility into how transactions are posted and in \\nwhat order to help you better manage your account.\\nWhen we transition from one business day to the next business day we post \\ntransactions to and from your account during our nightly processing. The \\norder in which we generally post transactions during nightly processing for \\neach business day is:\\n•  First, we make any previous day adjustments, and add deposits to your\\naccount.\\n•  Second, we subtract transactions in chronological order by using the date\\nand time of when the transaction was authorized or shown as pending.\\nThis includes ATM and Chase banker withdrawals, transfers and payments;\\nautomatic payments; chase.com  or Chase Mobile online transactions; checks\\ndrawn on your account; debit card transactions; wire transfers; and real time\\npayments. If multiple transactions have the same date and time, then they\\nare posted in high to low dollar order.\\n -  There are some instances where we do not have the time of the transaction\\ntherefore we post at the end of the day the transaction occurred:\\n• We are unable to show the transaction as pending; or\\n•  We don’t receive an authorization request from the merchant but the\\ntransaction is presented for payment.\\n•  Third, there are some transactions that we cannot process automatically or\\nuntil we’ve completed posting of your chronological transactions. This includes\\nOverdraft Protection transfers or transfers to maintain target balances in other\\naccounts. We subtract these remaining transactions in high to low dollar order.\\n• Finally, fees are assessed last.\\nIf you review your account during the day, you will see that we show\\nsome transactions as “pending.” For details, refer to the section “Pending”\\ntransactions in the Deposit Account Agreement . These transactions impact\\nyour available balance, but have not yet posted to your account and do not\\nguarantee that we will pay these transactions to your account if you have a\\nnegative balance at that time. We may still return a transaction unpaid if your\\nbalance has insufficient funds during that business day’s nightly processing,\\neven if it had been displayed as a “pending” transaction on a positive balance\\nduring the day. If a transaction that you made or authorized does not display\\nas “pending,” you are still responsible for it and it may still be posted against\\nyour account during nightly processing.\\nWhen Your Deposits \\nAre Available \\n(S\\nee Funds \\nAvailability Policy in \\nthe Deposit Account \\nAgreement for \\ndetails)\\n• Cash deposit – Same business day\\n• Direct deposit/wire transfer – Same business day\\n• Check deposit – Usually the next business day, but sometimes longer:\\n-  If we place a longer hold on a check, the first $225 will be available by the\\nnext business day\\n-  The date your deposit is expected to be available will be displayed on your\\nreceipt\\n-  In some situations, we may notify you at the time or after your deposit is\\nmade that your funds (including the first $225) will not be available for up to\\nseven business days\\nA “business day” is a non-holiday weekday.
